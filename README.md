# cmdash

**Layer-based terminal multiplexer and dashboard.** A single Rust
binary that hosts **real pseudoterminals** in recursive splits,
renders their text bodies with **`ratatui`**, and composes every
pane, widget, script process, and overlay as a **per-instance
layer** through the [dashcompositor](https://github.com/216598762/dashcompositor)
graphics layer stack. Output streams to the host terminal via the
**Kitty graphics protocol** (preferred) or **Sixel** (fallback).

cmdash owns **no** graphics path of its own — every pixel-level
render goes through dashcompositor first. The hard rule across the
entire codebase is **one layer per instance**: two visually adjacent
panes are always two different layers, even when the underlying
widget code is the same. That invariant is what makes nested
terminals with Kitty graphics safe, because graphics emitted from
one pane's child never leak into its neighbor.

## What cmdash is

A Rust workspace that combines:

- a **layout engine** — KDL-configured layout tree of
  `Split / Stack / ZStack / Pane / Preset` nodes (`cmdash-layout`),
- a **PTY layer** — `portable-pty` + `vte` per pane producing
  text grids (`cmdash-pty`),
- a **config surface** — KDL types + parser for keybinds,
  modifiers, layouts (`cmdash-config` + `cmdash-keybinds`), with
  runtime config file loading and hot-reload via filesystem watcher,
- a **ratatui text renderer** — per-frame cell-grid blit
  (`cmdash` binary, the integrator crate),
- a **dashcompositor layer-stack renderer** — per-instance
  `LayerId` ownership, passthrough Kitty-graphics encoder,
  Sixel fallback (`cmdash` + [`dashcompositor`](https://github.com/216598762/dashcompositor)
  git dep),
- a **plugin model** — c-ABI-safe dynamic widgets (`cmdash-widget-sdk`,
  planned) AND any executable speaking a line-delimited frame protocol
  as a "script widget" (`cmdash-protocol`, planned).

The `cmdash` binary in `crates/cmdash/src/main.rs` wires these
crates together. v1 is single-tab; every frame is one
`TickContext::run` pass through the workspace; unmatched key
presses are forwarded as raw bytes to the focused pane's PTY.

## Workspace layout

| Crate | Role |
| :--- | :--- |
| `cmdash` | binary + crate glue — event loop wiring, per-frame orchestration |
| `cmdash-config` | KDL config surface (`parse`, `KeyAction`, `LayoutNode`, `Pane`, `PaneKind`) |
| `cmdash-keybinds` | modifier-aware key router (`Router`), modes (`Normal` / `PaneResize` / `TabSwitch` / `PresetPick`), actions |
| `cmdash-layout` | layout tree engine (`ComputedLayout`, `Direction`, `PaneId`, `Rect`) — Split / Stack / ZStack / Pane / Preset |
| `cmdash-pty` | `portable-pty` + `vte` → text grid; kitty-graphics split; per-pane reader threads |
| `cmdash-widget-sdk` | c-ABI `CmdashWidget` trait for dynamic Rust widget `cdylib`s (stub) |
| `cmdash-protocol` | line-delimited script-widget frame protocol spec (stub) |

## Installation & Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/216598762/cmdash
cd cmdash
cargo build --workspace --release
```

Or install just the `cmdash` binary:

```bash
cargo install --path crates/cmdash
```

Build requirements:

- A recent stable Rust toolchain (1.73 floor).
- A C compiler and linker for the `dashcompositor` git dep.
- A PTY-allocation host (Linux `openpty` / macOS BSD pty).

## Running cmdash

```bash
# Default launch — no flags. Config loaded from ~/.config/cmdash/config.kdl
# (falls back to bundled default). Tracing writes to stdout at info level.
./target/release/cmdash

# Use a custom config file.
./target/release/cmdash --config=/path/to/my-config.kdl

# Capture every tracing event to a file. Stdout stays silent;
# a stderr banner announces the launch. Trace is forced in file mode.
./target/release/cmdash --log=/tmp/cmdash-debug.log

# Quiet on stdout — warnings + errors only.
RUST_LOG=warn ./target/release/cmdash
```

**Config resolution chain** (first match wins):
1. `--config=<path>` (explicit CLI override)
2. `$CMDASH_CONFIG_DIR/config.kdl` (env override)
3. `~/.config/cmdash/config.kdl` (XDG default)
4. Bundled `config.kdl` (compiled-in fallback)

When a config file path is resolved (priorities 1–3), cmdash
watches the file for changes at runtime — edits take effect
on the next tick without restarting.

The `--log=<path>` flag controls **where** tracing events land;
`RUST_LOG` controls **what** filter applies. They're orthogonal:
`--log=<path>` (file mode) ignores `RUST_LOG`; without it (stdout
mode), `RUST_LOG` is honored. See
[`docs/configuration.md`](./docs/configuration.md) for details.

## Bracketed paste support

cmdash supports the standard terminal bracketed-paste protocol. When a
child application emits `ESC[?2004h`, cmdash enables bracketed paste on
the host terminal and wraps subsequent pasted text in `ESC[200~` /
`ESC[201~` for that pane. The host state is the union across all live
panes, so focus changes do not disable the mode while another pane still
has it requested. See
[`docs/configuration.md`](./docs/configuration.md) §5.5 for details.

## Architecture (one frame)

The `TickContext::run` loop iterates `self.runners` once per frame:

- **Phase 0** — drain crossterm events; route keybinds or forward
  raw bytes to focused pane's PTY.
- **Phase 0.5** — coalesce host resize, re-resolve layout tree,
  resize each pane.
- **Phase 0.6** — drain config-reload channel; swap keybinds/presets;
  rebuild panes if layout changed.
- **Phase 1** — drain close-channel, poll exits, snapshot grids.
- **Phase 2** — route kitty graphics events into `GraphicsState`.
- **Phase 3a** — render text grids through ratatui.
- **Phase 3b** — emit dashcompositor kitty/sixel graphics.

`GraphicsState::set_cells((w, h))` keeps the framebuffer in sync
with the cell grid across host resizes.

## Local CI surface

Run `just --list` to enumerate all recipes:

```bash
# Strict-pin clippy residual count at 0.

cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
RUSTDOCFLAGS='-D rustdoc::broken-intra-doc-links' cargo doc -p cmdash --lib --no-deps
